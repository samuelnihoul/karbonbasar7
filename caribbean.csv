Esperanza power plant will be located in the Esperanza municipality, province of Valverde in the Dominican Republic.

Esperanza power plant will have an installed capacity of 90 MW  and involves the installation and construction of the following components: photovoltaic solar panels on embedded metal structures, three-phase inverters, transformers, medium and high voltage electrical networks, electrical substation, warehouse, administrative and control buildings, access roads, internal roads and platforms, parking lots, green areas, among others. In addition, it will have all the facilities for this type of project such as drinking water system, domestic wastewater system, system for the management and disposal of solid waste during the construction and operation stages of the project.
The energy that will be generated by the proposed project activity is currently dispatched by other grid-connected power plants. Hence, the baseline scenario and the scenario prior to project implementation are the same and in the absence of the proposed project, the electricity would have been generated by national grid connected plants, which includes fossil fueled power sources.
The project aims to provide clean, renewable, reliable, and sustainable energy to the National Interconnected Electrical System (SENI ) of the Dominican Republic. It will help in meeting the increasing demand for energy to bolster the nation’s expanding economy. By harnessing solar energy, an abundant renewable energy resource in the country, the project will not just provide clean energy to the national grid but will also reduce the high dependence on imported fossil fuels. In addition, the project will contribute towards bridging the gap between demand and supply of power and therefore, strengthening the national energy security. By generating an annual average of 198 312 MWh/y, the project is expected to reduce an average of 123 271 tCO2e of emissions annually, contributing to SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). The project will also contribute to SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by providing equal work opportunities to all, irrespective of discrimination on any basis.

A lack of safe drinking water and sanitation results in a host of healthcare issues including frequent, and sometimes deadly, water-borne illnesses. Much of these populations either uses untreated and unsafe water or, instead, uses wood and biofuels to purify their drinking, cleaning and washing water. This process results in the release of greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of wood.

"2564","Expanding access to LPG in Haiti through microfinance services","Entrepreneurs du Monde","Gold Standard Certified Project","13,3,15","Energy Efficiency - Domestic","Haiti","In Haiti more than 90% of the population cooks on charcoal-based stoves and do so using so called traditional ones. Such stoves are considered non-efficient and require large amount of charcoal to operate which translate into a significant cost for the user. More than 1.4 million tons of charcoal is this way used each year.  This  over-consumption  is  not  sustainable  and  is  an  important  reason  behind  the  acute deforestation and soil erosion problems found in this country. On top of that, emissions of greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of charcoal, significantly participate to the global problem that is climate change. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called PALMIS Enèji with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all.  This  program  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distribute  more  efficient  charcoal cookstoves,  LGP  cookstoves  and  solar  lanterns.  PALMIS Enèji is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. A new microcredit financial product is also  being  developed  with  the  support  of  ID  Microfinance  (a  local  microfinance  institution  and  also  a program  of  Entrepreneurs  du  Monde)  to  help  people  with  limited  financial  means  to  have  to  access  to those products. Finally, PALMIS Enèji is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as much as possible energy products in Haiti. The project activity  “Expanding LPG access in Haiti through microfinance services""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  charcoal  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fighting  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  gas  such  as  carbon  monoxide  inside households. Indeed, the combustion of charcoal with traditional stoves, generates toxic gas in the air.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cook stove,  instead  of  a  traditional  one,  means  the  end  user  is  saving significant amount of money because less fuel is needed for her/his cooking needs.","8623","GS TPDDTEC v 1.","Small Scale","Standalone",""

The improved charcoal model has been shown to reduce charcoal consumption in households by an average of 50%. The improved stove will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously offering benefits to families in the form of relief from high fuel costs and reduced exposure to health-damaging airborne pollutants. Additionally, the project will create over 80 permanent jobs and countless business opportunities in the country. Projected CO2 emissions reductions are more than 30,000 tons for the first year of the first CPA and will continue to rise as the project expands.  The introduction of efficient charcoal stoves into the market will require considerable financial investment, technical training, and management resources.  These resources are scarce in Haiti, particularly the availability of project financing funds.  Due to its high costs of operation and low margin on the charcoal stove the project is dependent on carbon financing being available and its launch is subject to approval from the leading voluntary emissions standard bodies. D&E will manufacture the EcoRecho stoves locally and will sell it through its network of distributors and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs. Enel Trade SpA (Enel) will purchase the Emission Reduction credits from the CPAs under the PoA, and will provide D&E up-front financing to install stove manufacturing machinery needed to scale up the project from the current pilot phase.","0","AMS-II.G.
